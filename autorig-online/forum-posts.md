**Title:** AutoRig Online - Free AI Character Rigging for Blender Artists

**Post Content:**

Hey Blender community! 👋

I'm excited to share a tool that might save you hours of manual rigging work. I built AutoRig Online - an AI-powered service that automatically rigs your 3D characters.

**What it does:**
- Takes your static character model (GLB, FBX, or OBJ)
- Generates professional bone structure
- Applies 50+ animations automatically
- Exports ready for Unity, Unreal, or web use

**Perfect for Blender artists who:**
- Export characters for game engines
- Need quick rigging for prototypes
- Want to focus on modeling, not rigging

**Free tier:** 3 conversions per IP, no signup required
**Pricing:** Very reasonable for power users

**Technical details:**
- AI analyzes mesh topology for optimal bone placement
- T-pose optimized for IK and animation retargeting
- Preserves materials and UVs
- Multiple export formats (GLB + FBX)

**Example workflow:**
1. Export character from Blender in T-pose
2. Upload to AutoRig Online
3. Wait 5-15 minutes
4. Download rigged character with animations

**Gallery:** Check out real examples at https://autorig.online/gallery

Would love to hear your feedback! Have you tried automated rigging tools before?

*Full disclosure: I'm the developer, but genuinely want to help the Blender community.*

**Title:** AutoRig Online - Professional Character Rigging in Minutes

**Post Content:**

**TL;DR:** AI-powered character rigging service. Upload static model → Download rigged + animated character. Free to try.

Hey Polycount! As someone who's spent countless hours manually rigging characters, I wanted to share a tool that could change how we approach rigging workflows.

**AutoRig Online** uses deep learning to automatically:
- Analyze character topology
- Generate anatomically correct bone structures
- Apply smooth skinning weights
- Include 50+ professional animations

**Supported workflows:**
- Game character pipelines (Unity/Unreal)
- VR/AR content creation
- WebGL applications
- Animation prototyping

**Quality comparison:**
- **Manual rigging:** 2-5 days, requires expertise
- **AutoRig:** 5-15 minutes, professional results

**Technical specs:**
- Input: GLB, FBX, OBJ (T-pose recommended)
- Output: Rigged GLB + Unity FBX + Unreal FBX
- Animations: Walk, run, jump, combat, idle sets
- IK setup: Foot/hand IK with pole targets

**Pricing:**
- Free: 3 conversions (great for testing)
- Paid: Scales with usage needs

**See it in action:** https://autorig.online/gallery

**Common questions:**
- "Is it as good as manual rigging?" → Rivals experienced riggers
- "What about complex characters?" → Handles armor, weapons, accessories
- "Unity Mecanim compatible?" → Yes, with proper naming conventions

The AI has been trained on thousands of character rigs, so it understands human/animal proportions and deformation requirements.

Thoughts? Has anyone here tried automated rigging solutions?

**Post Content:**

Hey r/blender!

If you're like me and hate spending days rigging characters, check out **AutoRig Online** - an AI tool I built that automatically rigs your Blender exports.

**How it works:**
1. Export character from Blender as GLB/FBX/OBJ (T-pose works best)
2. Upload to the website
3. AI analyzes and generates bones + skinning
4. Download rigged character with 50+ animations

**Results:** Professional quality rigs that work in Unity, Unreal, or web projects. The AI creates anatomically correct bone structures with proper IK setup.

**Free tier:** 3 conversions, no account needed
**Cost:** Very affordable for regular use

**Example:** I rigged a complex fantasy character in 8 minutes that would have taken me 2 days manually.

**Gallery with examples:** https://autorig.online/gallery

**For Blender users specifically:**
- Preserves your materials and UVs
- Exports back as GLB for web use
- FBX export ready for game engines
- No Blender plugin needed - works with any export

Have you struggled with rigging? This could be a game-changer for your workflow.

*I'm the developer - happy to answer questions!*
